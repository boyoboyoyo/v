## Introduction

Special relativity is a theory of the structure of spacetime. It was introduced in Einstein's 1905 paper "On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies". Special relativity is based on two postulates <span class="footnote-ref">[1]</span>:

1. The laws of physics are invariant (i.e., identical) in all inertial systems of reference (non-accelerating frames of reference)
2. The speed of light in a vacuum is the same for all observers, regardless of the motion of the light source

## Lorentz Transformations

The Lorentz transformation relates the coordinates of an event in one inertial reference frame to those in another <span class="footnote-ref">[2]</span>:

$$ t' = \gamma \left(t - \frac{vx}{c^2}\right) $$

$$ x' = \gamma (x - vt) $$

Where $\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$ is the Lorentz factor.

## Time Dilation

Moving clocks run slower relative to a stationary observer. The time dilation formula is:

$$ \Delta t' = \gamma \Delta t $$

This means that time passes more slowly for objects moving at high velocities relative to a stationary observer.

## Length Contraction

Objects appear shorter in the direction of motion when moving at relativistic speeds:

$$ L' = \frac{L}{\gamma} $$

## Mass-Energy Equivalence

Perhaps the most famous equation in physics, mass-energy equivalence states that:

$$ E = mc^2 $$

Where $E$ is energy, $m$ is mass, and $c$ is the speed of light in vacuum. This equation shows that mass can be converted to energy and vice versa <span class="footnote-ref">[3]</span>.

## Relativistic Momentum

At high velocities, the classical definition of momentum must be modified:

$$ \vec{p} = \gamma m \vec{v} $$

## Speed of Light Limit

As an object approaches the speed of light, its relativistic mass increases, requiring infinite energy to reach $c$. Therefore, no object with mass can reach or exceed the speed of light.

## Experimental Verification

Special relativity has been extensively tested and confirmed through numerous experiments:

* Muon lifetime extension in cosmic rays
* Atomic clocks on GPS satellites
* Particle accelerator experiments

## Conclusion

Special relativity fundamentally changed our understanding of space and time, showing they are not absolute but depend on the observer's frame of reference. These predictions have been confirmed by countless experiments and form the foundation of modern physics.
